# shell
This is a custom shell I made in c for a linux based environment. Currently it handles the following 10 commands, five of which are internal and remaining external.

1.) cd [path]
  changes the shell's working directory to the input path (can be relative or absolute).<br/>
  Ex. cd Desktop (shifts from current directory to Desktop).<br/>
  Extreme cases -> (No path provided)<br/>
    Shell prints path argument missing
    <br/>
                ->(Unreachable or wrong path provided)<br/>
    Shell prints wrong path provided<br/>
2.)
